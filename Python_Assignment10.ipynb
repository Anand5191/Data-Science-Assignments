        " much like a team working together.\n",

        "Reduces idle computer time : When one task is waiting for something, like loading a file, multithreading lets the computer do other work instead of doing nothing,\n",

        "\n",
        "Better system throughput : With multithreading, a computer can handle more tasks in the same amount of time, leading to more work being completed,\n",

        "Higher resource consumption : Using more threads can lead to using more of the computer’s memory and processing power.\n",
